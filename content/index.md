## Authoring Tools and ATAG

Authoring tools are software and services that "authors" (web
developers, designers, writers, etc.) use to produce web content (static
web pages, dynamic web applications, etc.). Examples of authoring tools
are listed below under "[Who ATAG is for](#who-atag-is-for)".

The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) explain how
to:

-   make the authoring tools themselves accessible, so that people with
    disabilities can create web content, ***and***
-   help authors create more accessible web content — specifically:
    enable, support, and promote the production of content that conforms
    to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
    ([WCAG]({{ "/standards-guidelines/wcag/" | relative_url }})).

ATAG is part of a series of accessibility guidelines, including the Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and the User Agent Accessibility
Guidelines (UAAG). [Essential Components of Web
Accessibility]({{ "/fundamentals/components/" | relative_url }}) explains the
relationship between the different guidelines.

ATAG was published in 2015 and as a technology agnostic standard remains relevant. The success criteria are technology agnostic and capture

## Who ATAG is for

ATAG is primarily for developers of authoring tools, including the
following types of authoring tools:

-   web page authoring tools, for example, what-you-see-is-what-you-get
    (WYSIWYG) HTML editors
-   software for generating websites, for example, content management
    systems (CMS) and learning management systems (LMS), courseware tools,
    content aggregators, no-code website builders
-   software that converts documents to web content technologies, for example,
    word processors and other office document applications with Save as
    HTML or EPUB
-   multimedia authoring tools
-   websites that let users add content, such as blogs, wikis, photo
    sharing sites, online forums, and social networking sites
-   other types of tools listed in the glossary definition of [authoring
    tools](http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#def-Authoring-Tool)

ATAG and supporting resources are also intended to meet the needs of
many different audiences, including policy makers, managers, and others.
For example:

-   People who want to [choose authoring
    tools](http://www.w3.org/WAI/impl/software) that are accessible and
    that produce accessible content can use ATAG to evaluate authoring
    tools.
-   People who want to encourage their existing authoring tool developer
    to improve accessibility in future versions can refer the authoring
    tool vendor to ATAG.

## What is in ATAG 2.0

[**ATAG 2.0**](http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/) has two main parts:

-   Part A is about making the authoring tool itself accessible.
-   Part B is about the authoring tool helping authors produce
    accessible content.

**ATAG 2.0** is organized in layers:

-   **Principles** provide high-level organization for the guidelines.
-   **Guidelines** provide the framework and objectives for the success
    criteria.
-   **Success criteria are the accessibility requirements**, which are
    written as testable statements, at [three
    levels](http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#intro_understand_levels_conformance):
    A, AA, AAA.

[**ATAG at a Glance**](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/atag-glance) provides
a short summary of the accessibility principles and guidelines in ATAG
2.0.

[**Implementing ATAG 2.0**](http://www.w3.org/TR/IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20/)
is a supporting informative document that helps readers understand and
use ATAG. Implementing ATAG 2.0 provides the rationale for each
guideline; and for each success criterion, it provides the further
explanation of the intent of the success criteria, examples, and links
to resources.

## ATAG Report Tool

The [**ATAG Report Tool**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/atag/report-tool/) helps evaluators report on the accessibility of authoring tools. It guides you through the ATAG requirements, lets you record your evaluation results for each requirement, and generates a report of the authoring tool's ATAG conformance.

## Translations

ATAG 2.0 is available as an Authorized W3C Translation in Chinese, Simplified: [无障碍创作工具指南(ATAG) 2.0](https://www.w3.org/Translations/ATAG20-zh/).

## Who developed ATAG

ATAG was developed by the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines
Working Group ([ATAG WG](http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/)) as part of
the World Wide Web Consortium ([W3C](http://www.w3.org/)) Web
Accessibility Initiative ([WAI](http://www.w3.org/WAI/)).
